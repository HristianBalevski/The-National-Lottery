# The-National-Lottery

The National Lottery is a simple game. To play, the participant must select 6 numbers from a range of 1 to 49. Subsequently, the computer will generate 6 random numbers. If all of the player's chosen numbers match the computer-generated ones, the player wins 1 million dollars. If the matched numbers fall between 3 and 5, the player will win a varying amount of money. If the matched numbers are fewer than 3, the player wins nothing.
